       <p><strong>About:</strong> <em>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</em> better known as A.P.J. Abdul Kalam(15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was the <em>11th President of India</em> from 2002 to 2007. A career scientist turned statesman, Kalam was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and studied <em>physics</em> and <em>aerospace engineering.</em> He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the <em>Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</em> and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the <em>Missile Man of India</em> for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in <em>India's Pokhran-II</em> nuclear tests in <em>1998,</em> the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974. Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in <em>2002</em> with the support of both the ruling <em>Bharatiya Janata Party</em> and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President," he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour. While delivering a lecture at the <em>Indian Institute of Management Shillong,</em> Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on <em>27 July 2015,</em> aged <em>83.</em> Thousands including national-level dignitaries attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of <em>Rameshwaram,</em> where he was buried with full state honours.</p>
